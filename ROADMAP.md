# Roadmap

Ultimately the goal is to reach feature parity for sorting, filtering, and paging with `react-table` but doing so in a typesafe way. Some features that seem to missing off the bat are...

-   Filtering
-   [ ] filtering individual columns

-   Sorting
-   [ ] sorting numbers on table seems to be broken [this might help](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/sortable-tables-react/)

-   General
-   [ ] multi column support
-   [ ] accessing nested objects with the column "name"
-   [ ] manual option for controlling data server side
